# Project-Admin-Dashboard

Completing this project took more amounts of time than I had first anticipated.
Using CSS Grid opened up new expanses but also caused a few blockades as I had to physically stop myself from using CSS Flex.
I experienced the aggravation of moving a single div and watching it coincidentally move another div on the other side.
But when I finally found the error and fixed it, the accomplishment erased all the pent up frustrations and replaced it with pure joy.

The project gave me free will over the color palette and text which I gladly took creative liberties with.
The HTML and CSS portion of this project was extensive compared to all my past projects.

The JavaScript portion of this project was left untouched until further notice (in the future when I go back to add extra tidbits and functions for a more interactive webpage)
